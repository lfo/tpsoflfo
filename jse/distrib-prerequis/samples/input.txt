Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. All byte stream classes are descended from InputStream and OutputStream.

There are many byte stream classes. To demonstrate how byte streams work, we'll focus on the file I/O byte streams, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Other kinds of byte streams are used in much the same way; they differ mainly in the way they are constructed.
Using Byte Streams
We'll explore FileInputStream and FileOutputStream by examining an example program named CopyBytes, which uses byte streams to copy xanadu.txt, one byte at a time.

    import java.io.FileInputStream;
    import java.io.FileOutputStream;
    import java.io.IOException;

    public class CopyBytes {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
            FileInputStream in = null;
            FileOutputStream out = null;
            try {
                in = new FileInputStream("xanadu.txt");
                out = new FileOutputStream("outagain.txt");
                int c;

                while ((c = in.read()) != -1) {
                    out.write(c);
                }

            } finally {
                if (in != null) {
                    in.close();
                }
                if (out != null) {
                    out.close();
                }
            }
        }
    }

CopyBytes spends most of its time in a simple loop that reads the input stream and writes the output stream, one byte at a time, as shown in the following figure.
